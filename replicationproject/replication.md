### Related project 1 ###
Bad Mother/ Good mother 

Anna Rust audiovisual performance is related to my project as it is using electronic audio and songs as well as with a visual performance to create an interactive work. Her work gave me an example on how my porject does not need to be complex and how I can use and change everyday object into an interactive device.

At the Queensland Museum there is a Exhibition called Sparklab where there is interactive science, technology, engineering and maths, ideal for 6 to 13 years old. 

By exploring the 'sparklab' page I reached an understanding on how interactive media can be fin, explorative, creative amd bring people together.

### Related project 3 ###
Papir Machine, is an interactive booklet that you can make STEM toys. This happens through the combination of paper with an electronic circuitry. 

In the booklet there are six electronic paper toys which are resistance, gyroscope, playing track, wind sensor, writing tack and tilt switch. 

I'm amazed how this person was able to transform paper with electronics into an interactive media. It's a good example on how materials and forms of the media doesn't need to be overcomplicated and sophisticated.

### Related project 4 ###
Lorenzo Braviâ€™s Hit The Beat is an interactive drum machine that can play music by using everyday objects. This is possible, as the machine is based on an Arduino platform (this was also mentioned in the 'Prototyping Interactive Objects' artcicale/reading). 

An Arduino platform is an open-source hardware that has designed several single-board microcontrollers and kits that allows user to build their own digital devices. 

Using the software, it performs as the translator of a message in midi format and triggers a physical solenord percussion. 

He combined music, electronics and everyday objects to create something the audience is familiar and unfamiliar with.

### Related project 5 ###
Roxanne Brennen created a selection of dinning tools that enhance the pleasure of eating by realising endorphins just like sex does. 

They trigger the same brain activity as sexual foreplay. 

 "Your brain reacts to eating the same way that it reacts to sex," Brennen told Dezeen. "It's all about the pleasure centre being activated and the number of endorphins released."

Her work exapnded my boxed thinking of how interactive media has to be practical and make logical sense. I realised that it really doesn't have to be like that.

## Reading reflections ##

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before:
Before reading the source, I went into the reading thinking that it was going to be all about the electronic and practical designing of everyday things. 

*What I learned:
Once I finished the reading, I was surprised about what the actual article was about and the information that read. As a result, I developed an understanding on how as human we interact with objects and experiences by our discovery. And how we discover things through affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback and conceptual models. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on: 
This reading relates to my project because in order to create a product or interactive work which audiences can have a good experience. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before:
What I thought before was that miscrointeractions are not that important and significiant to making a product effective. 

*What I learned:
Out of all three of the readings, I found that i gained the most insight and information from Dan Saffer's chapter on Designing Microinteractions. Such as, how microinteractions are all around us in our every day lives and how they make or break a product and object from being successful. 

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: 
Before reading the article I still was experiencing some difficultly fully understanding the grasp on how to make a interactive object or product successfully. So when I saw the title of the article I assumed it had step by step instructions on 'Protyping Interactive Objects.' However my assumation was challenged as I realised this was about Scott Sullivan's experience on protyping an interactive objects and the mistakes, failues, successes and findings throughout that experience.*

*What I learned: 
Before the reading I had thought that designers must find it extremely difficult and challenging to come up with an idea of a product or oject to design and create. But as a result from the reading, I came to an understand that designers entire purpose is to take in many inputs and develop a soultion which in other words they find the needs of users or business, etc. and aim to construct a design to combat it. 

*What I would like to know more about:
What is the creative process that someone goes through to discover an idea for a object or product? How does protyping interactive objects impact your creativity as an artist?

*How this relates to the project I am working on: 
The idea in this reading that could be used to improve my project is when coming across a flaw, error or problem in my prototype, that I should go back to the drawing board and brainstorm soultions. 


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

The challenging part that I struggled with throughout the entire project was trying to brainstorm a design and porduct idea. Evenafter going through enless protypes, rsearching interactive products, musical interactive desings or performance or works and the NIME website, I still found that I had a mental block. So when I sat down to sketch some designs I saw some cardboard laying on the shelf and thought that the cardboard would be an effective and easier material to use for the project design. In the end I came up with creating a musical that makes various tones and when tilted in different directions. The age bracket would be for under 10 year olds.

I calculated the length and width of the box by measuring space and length of the microbit with the crocodile chips and earphones and the battery. Once I found that I doubled that measurement for the sides of the box which were 13cm long. I outlined the 6 sides on the cardboard using the square piece that I cut. Also the indication plan was to use an old nutella jar inside the box so it can hold the crocodile clips and ballery however after giving it a try the container would weigh too much and it was't practical.

On each square cardboard piece I added boarders on two sides opposite of each other. 
![Image](https://github.com/cfrangosqca/1701QCA-Assessment1/blob/master/replicationproject/7.JPG)

To find the size of the microbit I pressed it against a piece of paper to get the imprint of the buttons and drew around it to get the outline. Using that I used a rule to get the exact measurements to sketch on one square and then make the incision.

Once I had taped the microbit through the incision and open window of the square piece. I realised that the around the window you could see the inside of the cardboard material and it was extremely unflattering. I had also remember how in the tutorial we discussed that appearance is a vital and essential part and detail of a product as it determines how appealing it can be for audience and viewers. Because in reality if it doesnt look good or at least partly appealing then consumers will not want to interactive with the device which basically defeats the purpose. So to create a clean edge and make it look a lot more appealing I taped washi tape around the window. 
![Image](https://github.com/cfrangosqca/1701QCA-Assessment1/blob/master/c/12.JPG)

For the earphone I pressed the speaker side onto the cardboard to get the imprint and cut the the oval shape with a heavy duty knife. The hole was unevenly also because you could see the inside and lining of the cardboard material it looked unfinished. I sealed it off with the same tape that was used for the microbit window. However after using a unusal technique it ended up looking worse then it did before:
![Image](https://github.com/cfrangosqca/1701QCA-Assessment1/blob/master/replicationproject/15.JPG)

The reason it resulted like that was because I attempted to curve the tape around the hole but that made folds of the tape. I removed it and started over again with a different techique. The modification:

After all of the sections and small important details were completed then I was able to begin assembling the parts of the box together. 
I glued two side at a time and let them dry before moving on to the next. All the side glued together:
