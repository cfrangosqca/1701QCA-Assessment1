*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

Anna Rust audiovisual performance is related to my project as it is using electronic audio and songs as well as with a visual performance to create an interactive work. Her work gave me an example on how my porject does not need to be complex and how I can use and change everyday object into an interactive device. 

## Reading reflections ##

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before:
Before reading the source, I went into the reading thinking that it was going to be all about the electronic and practical designing of everyday things. 

*What I learned:
Once I finished the reading, I was surprised about what the actual article was about and the information that read. As a result, I developed an understanding on how as human we interact with objects and experiences by our discovery. And how we discover things through affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback and conceptual models. 

*How this relates to the project I am working on: 
This reading relates to my project because in order to create a product or interactive work which audiences can have a good experience. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before:
What I thought before was that miscrointeractions are not that important and significiant to making a product effective. 

*What I learned:
Out of all three of the readings, I found that i gained the most insight and information from Dan Saffer's chapter on Designing Microinteractions. Such as, how microinteractions are all around us in our every day lives and how they make or break a product and object from being successful. 

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: 
Before reading the article I still was experiencing some difficultly fully understanding the grasp on how to make a interactive object or product successfully. So when I saw the title of the article I assumed it had step by step instructions on 'Protyping Interactive Objects.' However my assumation was challenged as I realised this was about Scott Sullivan's experience on protyping an interactive objects and the mistakes, failues, successes and findings throughout that experience.*

*What I learned: 
Before the reading I had thought that designers must find it extremely difficult and challenging to come up with an idea of a product or oject to design and create. But as a result from the reading, I came to an understand that designers entire purpose is to take in many inputs and develop a soultion which in other words they find the needs of users or business, etc. and aim to construct a design to combat it. 

*What I would like to know more about:
What is the creative process that someone goes through to discover an idea for a object or product? How does protyping interactive objects impact your creativity as an artist?

*How this relates to the project I am working on: 
The idea in this reading that could be used to improve my project is when coming across a flaw, error or problem in my prototype, that I should go back to the drawing board and brainstorm soultions. 


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

The challenging part that I struggled with throughout the entire project was trying to brainstorm a design and porduct idea. Evenafter going through enless protypes, rsearching interactive products, musical interactive desings or performance or works and the NIME website, I still found that I had a mental block. So when I sat down to sketch some designs I saw some cardboard laying on the shelf and thought that the cardboard would be an effective and easier material to use for the project design. In the end I came up with creating a musical that makes various tones and when tilted in different directions. The age bracket would be for under 10 year olds.

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
