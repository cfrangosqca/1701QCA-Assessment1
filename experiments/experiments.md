### Experiment 1 - 'Say Hello to the BBC mircobit" ###

This is the code of the experiment. It took me a while to located each block and part. 

#### Reflection ####

The first experiemnt was interesting and a little difficult as I am new to coding. What I didn't understand was the meaning of each block and what effect they had when joined together.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (a nintendo gameboy).


### Experiment 3 - 'Dimming an led using a potentiometter'3 ###

The coding for the experiment. 

#### Reflection ####

I attempted this experiment three times as I wasn't able to get it to work even though the coding was correct until I realised that I had used a light sensor instead of an LED pin. What I learnt was each wire, resistor or another needed part is important and creates a circuit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (a controlled light switch).

### Experiment 4 - 'Using a transistor to drive a motor' ###

I had a lot of difficulty with this experiment because I did not know that in order to attach the motor to the terminal connector that you need to unscrew the screws and connect the red and back pins into the connector. So, I tried over and over again to somewhere push the pins into the connector without the correct knowledge, until I visited the website and watched the video where the man explained how you must unscrew the screws which will open the holes for the red and black wires to pass through.

When I was having trouble, I made sure to double check the coding was correct as it had shown in the booklet.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (how to connect a motor to an terminal connector).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (motor powered boat).

### Experiment 5 - 'Using the accelertometer to control motor speed' ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

Unfortunately I was unable to complete this experiment because for some reason it would not work. I reviewed the code several times yet still it would not work. When I look back I'm sure I missed a part or I might've not connected the black and red wire from the motor to the terminal connector.

The coding for the experiment. After reviewing the code format several times there was no identified error or mistake.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (when your circuit seems not be working to always go over the coding, circuit on the breadboard and that each part is securely pinned on the board).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (unsure).

### Experiment 6 - 'Setting the tone with a piezo Buzzer' ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

Out of all the experiments, this was the only circuit I was able to understood how it worked. I made connections to how the yellow and black jumper wires make the buzzer function. The circuit diagram was difficult to understand and interpret.

At first glance of the JavaScript I thought it was going to be extremely difficult to write out and interpret into a code format.

The coding from the JavaScript. 

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (how a blocking code looks when you translate it into a JavaScript).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (website).

### Experiment 7 - 'Wind Power' ###

#### Photo of completed project ####

I am very proud of completing this experiment because I faced a lot of failures in the past ones and was ready to give up. With patient and care I managed to get the motor to work with the JavaScript.

From experiment 6 when I saw that the requirement and task was to create the following JavaScript code, I was ready to give up and not complete the experiment. Yet I decided to give this a go. Along the way I made a few mistakes with the input.onButtonPressed and pins.analogReadPin but I went back to review the code and corrected the errors.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (how to create a JavaScript Code).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (unsure).
